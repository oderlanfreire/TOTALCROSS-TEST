Question: Primes Below a Given Number https://edabit.com/challenge/BaCBEFhhxrmpQXEcH

To this question, I've used a chained loop, a vector and two variable (an aux and an count), to solve, I had started a variable aux with the value 0 and the first loop with the iterator called "i" with value equals to 2, finishing when the iterator get the value equals to the numbers given by parameter, and insert the count with value 0, after, I started the second loop with the iterator called "j" with value equals to 2, finishing when the iterator get the value equals to the value of "i", inside of the second loop, I've used a conditional, if the rest of "i" by "j" equals 0 the count will be incrased. Out of the loop with iterator "j" and inside the loop with iterator "i", I've used another conditional, if the value of count it's equals to 1, the vector in the aux position receive the value of the iterator "i" and the value of aux will be incrased. In any new iteration of "i", the count will be reset to the value 0, making the algorithim work.

To the output, outside of the chained loop, I already print the first bracket, opening to insert the values, and I've used another loop, to walk in the vector and print his value in the position, but I had used another condition, if the iterator was smaller than the value of aux less 1, will be print the value of the vector in the position of the interator plus an comma, else will be print the value of the vector in the position of the interator plus the second backet, and the backets close with the values inside.
