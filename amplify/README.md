I solved this question on this way, utilizing an vector, an loop and an conditional, receveing a number, inside the loop, i filled the array starting in 1 until the number that I received, at the same time, verifeing if the number in the position "i" was divisible by 4 using a conditional, if was divisible, the array on the position "i" receive the value of "i" multiplied by 10.
To the output, I utilized a loop to print the current values in the array.
